# isv-demo-site-template

A web app for Salesforce Partners to use to help market their App in Sales Demos.  Use this web app template to configure a webpage on your very own Heroku app.  The page will be used by SE's to learn how to use your app in their demo.  Please follow the best practices listed on the configuration page.   

## Inspiration

A common request ISV partners make focuses on getting their app showcased in demos.  Often SE's lack the time to learn how to demo specific salesforce apps.  To solve this problem we ask ISV partners to follow the demo kit best practices, which goes as follows:
1. Partner hosted landing page
1. Demo Packages (unmanaged or managed, managed is recommended to allow updates)
1. Demo Guides (pdf on how to demo what)
1. Setup Instructions (pdf on how to setup the demos)
1. A dedicated contact for technical and demo help
Based off of these best practices, we are providing this web template for partners to use to host their own landing page with other necessary information for SE's to demo their app.

## Usage
1. [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
1. Make sure to add a `config_password`
1. Go to `<your_app>.herokuapp.com/config`
1. Enter your `config_password`
1. Add your App details and click Save
1. Click Submit to Salesforce when you feel your page is complete.

## Customization

This app is written in javascript, using node.js and react.js.  It's setup to showcase a standard set of data about salesforce apps\'s to SE's, and allows users that are unfamiliar with javascript to customize it.  You are allowed to modify the app and javascript as much as you want, but no support will be guaranteed.
